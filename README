Mumble for iPhoneOS Beta Portal
===============================

This project serves as the "beta portal" of the Mumble client for iPhoneOS.
It is a small chunk of Python code that's built to run off Google App Engine.

Setting it up
=============

The beta portal uses the Flask microframework, which depends on Jinja2 and Werkzeug.
To get up and running:

 $ pip install flask

Then, to package up the dependencies for use on App Engine, you must run

 $ scripts/genassets.py

from the project root directory to generate a 'modules.zip', which is basically
just an opaque container that includes all of the modules we depend on that aren't
already on App Engine.
